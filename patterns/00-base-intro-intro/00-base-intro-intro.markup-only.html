  <h1>Welcome to the AMA Style Guide</h1>
  <p>Click the "all" link or navigation above to browse styles. You can search for patterns using "Find Pattern" in the gear on the right. View the <a href="https://github.com/AmericanMedicalAssociation/AMA-style-guide/releases/latest" class="link">latest release <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/release/AmericanMedicalAssociation/AMA-style-guide.svg" alt="Latest Release"></a> or 00-link.twig on GitHub.
  <h2>Working with our style guide</h2>
  <h3>Structure</h3>
  <p>This living style guide is built with 00-link.twig and adheres to the principles of 00-link.twig.</p>
  <h3>Issues</h3>
  <p>If you have questions or encounter an issue working with the style guide, report it as 00-link.twig.</p>
  <h3>Contributions</h3>
  <p>For any code that you would like to contribute to the style guide, first create an issue in Github explaining clearly what problem you are trying to solve.</p>
  <p>Make sure you have adhered to the guidelines outlined in the 00-link.twig before submitting a pull request. Reference the Github issue you created when you submit your pull request.</p>
  <h3>Annotation and Documentation</h3>
  <p>Each pattern should have its own accompanying 00-link.twig file that contains 1) a useful description of the pattern and 2) links to the relevant Jira tickets/Github issues relating to that pattern's creation. This information is needed to provide context as to how and when  a particular pattern should be used.</p>
