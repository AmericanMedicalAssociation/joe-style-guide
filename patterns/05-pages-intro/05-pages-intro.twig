  <h3>Structure</h3>
  <p>This living style guide is built with

    and adheres to the principles of
    {% include 'link.twig' with {'link': { 'text' : 'Atomic Design' , 'href' : 'http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/', 'target': '_blank'}} %}.

  </p>
  <h3>Contributions</h3>
  <p>For any code that you would like to contribute to the style guide, first create an issue in Github explaining clearly what problem you are trying to solve.</p>
  <p>Make sure you have adhered to the guidelines outlined in the
  {% include 'link.twig' with {'link': { 'text' :'Code Conventions documentation' , 'href' : 'https://github.com/AmericanMedicalAssociation/joe-style-guide/blob/develop/docs/code_conventions.md'}} %}

  </p>
  <h3>Annotation and Documentation</h3>
  <p>Each pattern should have its own accompanying
  {% include 'link.twig' with {'link': { 'text' :'Markdown' , 'href' : 'https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/', 'target': '_blank'}} %}
  file that contains 1) a useful description of the pattern and 2) link to the relevant Jira tickets/Github issues relating to that pattern's creation.
  This information is needed to provide context as to how and when  a particular pattern should be used.
