          <p>One of the most recognized paintings of Western medicine, Luke Fildes’ The Doctor was hailed as an ideal representation of caring when it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art in 1891. Henry Tate wanted an English painting worthy of a new gallery in his name, but he left the subject matter of his commission to Fildes.</p>
