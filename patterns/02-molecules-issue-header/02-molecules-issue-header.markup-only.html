    <div class="joe__issue-header__desc">
    The arts have long been used as cultivators of reflection and storytelling about health and health care. Like novels, short stories, painting, sculpture, and film, comics can convey poignant stories, deliver analytical depth, and offer interpretive alternatives to text-based ethical inquiry. The February 2018 issue of the AMA Journal of Ethics will explore comics’ power to visually represent and comment on health care and health care experiences, guide patients’ and clinicians’ learning, and approach consideration of values in health care not only ethically but aesthetically.
